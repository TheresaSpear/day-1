  <h1>Hello World</h1>
  <p>My name is Theresa</p>

  <!-- What I did before codeworks -->
  <p>Before starting at Codeworks on 1/28/19 I have worked in the accounting field. Some of the things I have done
    previously are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Accounts payable</li>
    <li>Accounts receivable</li>
    <li>Payroll</li>
  </ul>


  <!-- What I hope to get out of this course -->

  <p>While I enjoyed what I did, I felt like it was time for a change!</p>
  <p>While I have learned some basic stuff prior to this course I feel like I am missing pieces of the puzzle and/or
    don't know how to put them together. I am confident this course will help immensely.</p>
  <!-- Things I enjoy -->
  <p>Some of my favorite things</p>
